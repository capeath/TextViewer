Lift high the name of Jesus,<br>of Jesus our King.###Make known the power of His grace,<br>the beauty of His peace.###Remember how His mercy reached<br>and we cried out to Him.###He lifted us to solid ground,<br>to freedom from our sin.###Oh sing, my soul,<br>And tell all He's done###'Til the earth and heavens<br>are filled with His glory.###Lift high the name of Jesus,<br>of Jesus our Lord.###His pow'r in us is greater than,<br>is greater than this world.###To share the reason for our hope,<br>to serve with love and grace###That all who see Him shine through us<br>might bring the Father praise.###Oh sing, my soul,<br>And tell all He's done###'Til the earth and heavens<br>are filled with His glory.###Lift high the name of Jesus,<br>of Jesus our Light.###No other name on earth can save,<br>can raise us a soul to life.###He opens up our eyes to see<br>the harvest He has grown.###We labor in His fields of grace,<br>as He leads sinners home.###Oh sing, my soul,<br>And tell all He's done###'Til the earth and heavens<br>are filled with His glory.###<EOF>###
