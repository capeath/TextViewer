Joy to the world!<br>The Lord is come.###Let earth receive her King;<br>let every heart prepare Him room,###and heaven and nature sing,<br>and heaven and nature sing,###and heaven, and heaven<br>and nature sing.###Joy to the world!<br>The Savior reigns;###let us our songs employ,<br>while fields and floods,###rocks, hills, and plains,<br>repeat the sounding joy,###repeat the sounding joy,<br>repeat, repeat the sounding joy,###No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br>nor thorns infest the ground.###He comes to make His blessings flow<br>far as the curse is found,###far as the curse is found,<br>far as, far as the curse is found.###He rules the world<br>with truth and grace,###and makes the nations prove<br>the glories of His righteousness,###and wonders of His love,<br>and wonders of His love,###and wonders, wonders of His love.###EOF
