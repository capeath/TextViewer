Angels we have heard on high,<br>singing sweetly through the night,###and the mountains in reply<br>echoing their brave delight.###Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br>Gloria in excelsis Deo.###Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br>Why these songs of happy cheer?###What great brightness did you see?<br>What glad tidings did you hear?###Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br>Gloria in excelsis Deo.###Come to Bethlehem and see<br>him whose birth the angels sing;###come, adore on bended knee<br>Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.###Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br>Gloria in excelsis Deo.###See him in a manger laid<br>whom the angels praise above;###Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,<br>while we raise our hearts in love.###Gloria in excelsis Deo.<br>Gloria in excelsis Deo.###EOF
