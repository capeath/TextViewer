Christ is alive! Let Christians sing. His cross stands<br>empty to the sky. Let streets and homes with###praises ring. His love in death shall never die.###Christ is alive! No longer bound to distant<br>years in Palestine, He comes to claim the###here and now and conquer every place and time.###Not throned above, remotely high, untouched,<br>unmoved by human pains, but daily in the###midst of life, our Savior with the Father reigns.###In every insult, rift, and war where color,<br>scorn, or wealth divide, He suffers still, yet###loves the more, and lives, through ever crucified.###Christ is alive! His Spirit burns through this and<br>every future age, till all creation lives###and learns His joy, His justice, love, and praise.###EOF
