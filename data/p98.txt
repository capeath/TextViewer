O sing unto the Lord a new song,<br>for He has done marvelous things.###With His own right hand and with His holy arm,<br>He has won for Himself the victory.###The Lord declared His salvation;###His righteousness has He openly shown<br>in the sight of the nations.###He has remembered His mercy and truth<br>toward the house of Israel,###and all the ends of the world have<br>seen the salvation of our God.###Show yourselves joyful in the Lord,<br>all you lands; sing, rejoice, and give thanks.###Praise the Lord with the harp;<br>sing with the harp a psalm of thanksgiving.###With trumpets also and horns,<br>O show yourselves joyful before the Lord, the King.###Let the sea make a noise, and all that is in it,<br>the round world, and those who dwell therein.###Let the rivers clap their hands, and let<br>the hills be joyful together before the Lord,###for He has come to judge the earth.###With righteousness shall He judge the world,<br>and the peoples with equity.###EOF
