I come with joy to meet my Lord,<br>forgiven, loved, and free,###in awe and wonder to recall<br>His life laid down for me.###I come with Christians far and near<br>to find, as all are fed,###the new community of love<br>in Christ’s communion bread.###As Christ breaks bread and bids us share,<br>each proud division ends.###That love that made us makes us one,<br>and strangers now are friends.###And thus with joy we meet our Lord.<br>His presence, always near,###is in such friendship better known.<br>We see and praise Him here.###Together met, together bound,<br>we’ll go our different ways,###and as His people in the world<br>we’ll live and speak His praise.###EOF
